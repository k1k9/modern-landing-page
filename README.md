# Moder landing page
Hello, this is my landing page, which I created some time ago and only now I decided to put it on my github. To create this page I use preprocessor SCSS and module [sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass) from npm. Images what I used is from [unDraw](https://undraw.co/) and CSS framework is [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

## Can I use this template?
Yes you can, but if you want use this for commercial purpose please contact with me
